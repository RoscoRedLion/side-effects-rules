        <p>You start the game with unique disorders. As you treat these disorders with drugs, the drugs leave you vulnerable to getting additional disorders from other players.</p>
        <p>You win by treating yourself completely before anyone else.</p>

        <p>There are four types of cards in the deck (we’ll talk about bonus cards later):

<code>DISORDERS</code> - <code>DRUGS</code> - <code>EPISODES</code> - <code>THERAPY</code>

Separate all the Disorders from the deck. Shuffle them and deal out 4 per player face up in front of them. This is henceforth referred to as their Psyche. If you’re playing with 6+ people, deal out only 3 Disorder cards for their Psyche.</p>
        <p>A Psyche can never hold 2 of the same Disorders, so if this happens, simply place the card on the bottom of the deck and deal out the next one.
Next, shuffle the remaining Disorders into the deck and deal out 4 cards per player face down. This is henceforth referred to as their Hand.
The rest of the deck becomes the draw pile. Discarded cards should be placed face up next to it (discard pile). Turns move clockwise. The player who had a nightmare most recently goes first.</p>

        <p>Using the contents of your Hand, be the first to treat all the Disorders in your Psyche. You may keep playing until there’s one sick loser left.</p>

      id="Turns">
        <header>Turns</header>
        <p>Start your turn by drawing 2 cards. You can play up to 2 cards on your turn, but you’re not compelled to play anything if you don’t want to.
At the end of your turn, you cannot have more than 6 cards in your hand—place extra cards into the discard pile.</p>
        <p>ON YOUR TURN, YOU MAY...
        <ol>
        <li>Treat a Disorder in your Psyche: if you have a Drug that treats one of the Disorders in your Psyche, you can place it on top of that Disorder</li>
        <li>Give another player a Disorder: every Drug has a list of side effects written under “MAY CAUSE”.
When someone has a Drug on top of a Disorder card in their Psyche, they are vulnerable to receiving any of the Disorders from that list of side effects from other players. So, if you have a Disorder in your hand that another player is vulnerable to receiving, you can add that Disorder to their Psyche.
It’s important to point out that no Psyche can have 2 of the same Disorder. So even if someone is vulnerable to receiving a Disorder, once they’ve got it, they can’t get it again. This includes Disorders that are being treated with Drugs.</li>
        <li>Use a Therapy card: this is like a wild card. You use it by taking any Disorder from your Psyche and placing it, with the Therapy card, into the discard pile.
The only card that Therapy does not work on is Tremors. It’s also worth mentioning that there’s no Drug for Anorexia—you must treat this with Therapy. The only downside of treating a Disorder with Therapy is that the Disorder is no longer in your Psyche and that means that you could, in theory, get it again.</li>
        <li>Give someone an Episode: use this card to trigger any of the punishments listed on another player’s untreated Disorders.
Take a look at your opponents’ Disorders and read the punishments written on them. Once you’ve found the punishment you’d like to trigger, drop your Episode card onto that Disorder. The other player MUST comply. Discard the Episode card after use. You may laugh at their misery.</li>
Once there no more cards in the draw pile, shuffle the discard pile and use that as the draw pile.
        </ol>

        <p>You may make deals with other players, but be sure to adhere to the following rules:</p>
        <p>
        <ol>
          <li>You cannot put more than 2 cards into play on your turn.</li>
          <li>You cannot put any cards into play when it’s not your turn.</li>
          <li>You may give and receive cards when it’s not your turn as long as they’re not put into play.</li>

        <p>These are not officially allowed, but neither is collecting everyone’s taxes when you land on Free Parking! Your house, your rules.</p>

        <p>On occasion, we will create bonus cards to make Side Effects even more zesty. Use them like a spice (as much or as little as you’d like). In the Kickstarter special edition, we included the following two:</p>
        <p><code>Misdiagnosis:</code> this card allows you to swap one of the Disorders from your Psyche with one from your Hand. One of the best parts of this card is that you get to keep the card you swapped out of your Psyche! Discard Misdiagnosis after use.

</p>
        <p><code>High Tolerance:</code> this card forces another player to remove a Drug from their Psyche. You choose which one. Discard the Drug and the High Tolerance card after use.
